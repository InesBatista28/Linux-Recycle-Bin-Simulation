# Linux Recycle Bin Simulator — Technical Documentation
This project implements a Linux Recycle Bin Simulator using pure Bash scripting.
It replicates the behavior of a recycle bin, allowing users to delete, restore, search, list, and empty files or directories without permanent loss until explicitly emptied.

The system uses a hidden directory (~/.recycle_bin) containing structured subfolders and metadata to track deleted items safely.
