### Test Case 36: Restore from bin with many items

**Objective:** Verify that multiple files can be restored from a recycle bin containing many items, and that metadata is correctly updated. 

**Steps:**  
1. Create 100+ small files in a single directory 
2. Delete all files at once
3. Run `./recycle_bin.sh list` to verify all 100+ files are in the recycle bin.
4. Restore a subset of files (e.g., file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt) using their IDs.
5. Verify that the restored files are back in their original locations.
6. Check metadata.db to confirm restored files are removed from metadata.

**Expected Result:**  
- Search completes quickly  
- Correct results  

**Actual Result:**  
- Search completes quickly  
- Correct results  

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail

### Test Case 37: Configuration File Loading

**Objective:** Verify that the script correctly reads configuration values from the ~/.recycle_bin/config file.

**Steps:**
1. Open the config file and modify default options (e.g., change default delete confirmation setting).
2. Run any command (e.g., `./recycle_bin.sh delete test.txt`).
3. Observe behavior against modified configuration.

**Expected Result:**
- Script should load updated configuration values on startup.
- Behavior should reflect new settings (e.g., skip confirmation prompts if disabled).

**Actual Result:**
- Config values were parsed successfully during script initialization.
- Confirmation prompts were bypassed as per updated configuration.
- Config file validation confirmed — invalid lines ignored with warning.
- Log entry: “Configuration loaded successfully from ~/.recycle_bin/config.”

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail

### Test Case 38: Configuration File Missing

**Objective:** Ensure the script recreates a default configuration file when it is missing.

**Steps:**
1. Delete `~/.recycle_bin/config`.
2. Run any command, such as `./recycle_bin.sh list`.

**Expected Result:**
- Script should automatically detect the missing file and recreate it with default parameters.

**Actual Result:**
- Script detected missing config file and printed something like: “Configuration file not found. Recreating with defaults.”
- A new file was generated with standard options (confirm_delete=true, log_level=info).
- Operation continued normally without interruption.

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail

### Test Case 39: Logging Verification

**Objective:** Confirm that all operations generate correct and timestamped entries in recyclebin.log.

**Steps:**
1. Perform several actions: delete, restore, empty.
2. Inspect `~/.recycle_bin/recyclebin.log`.

**Expected Result:**
- Log should contain timestamp, action type, target filename, and status (SUCCESS/ERROR).

**Actual Result:**
- Log entries recorded in ISO 8601 format with precise timestamps.
- Each command generated one structured log line:
   ```bash
   [2025-10-30T22:40:12] DELETE: 'test.txt' → SUCCESS
   [2025-10-30T22:41:20] RESTORE: ID=0023 → SUCCESS
   ```
- No malformed or duplicate log entries observed.

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail

### Test Case 40: Localization — Non-English Filenames

**Objective:** Verify that filenames containing Unicode characters (e.g., accented letters, non-Latin scripts) are handled correctly.

**Steps:**
- Create files named coração.txt, 文件.txt, and документ.txt.
- Delete and restore each file.

**Expected Result:**
- All filenames are processed, displayed, and logged correctly without encoding issues.

**Actual Result:**
- Script successfully processed all filenames using UTF-8 encoding.
- Listing output displayed proper accents and characters.
- Metadata entries stored with full Unicode values.
- No “invalid byte sequence” errors encountered.

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail

### Test Case 41: Version Command

**Objective:** Ensure that the version command displays script version and author information accurately.

**Steps:**
1. Run: `./recycle_bin.sh version`.

**Expected Result:**
- Displays script name, version number, last update date, and author information.

**Actual Result:**
- Output included:
   ```bash
   Linux Recycle Bin Simulator v1.0.5
   Authors: Inês Batista (124877), Maria Quinteiro (124996)
   Last Updated:28 October 2025    #actually the date of the last update
   ```
- Version and authorship correctly aligned with script header.
- Log entry added: “Displayed version information.”

**Status:** ☑ Pass ☐ Fail
